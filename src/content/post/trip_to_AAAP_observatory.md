Stars are the lanturns in the sky. They are the wishes of our ancestors, as well as the call of happiness.

## Evening trip to AAAP Observatory

Before we embarked on our trip to the AAAP, flashes of red appeared in the night sky.  It was the first time I saw the Aurora. The red of the northern lights just blended with the deep sky perfectly.

After entering the observatory, I found out that the telescope was pointed at Saturn. To the naked eye, Saturn appeared as just a tiny point in the sky. However, through the telescope, I could clearly see the rings of Saturn. It was so clear that it seemed unreal, almost like looking at a picture online. After that, we also observed the M27 nebula, which had exploded and released chemicals and gases, and had a white dwarf star at its center.

While I was at the observatory, I had the opportunity to chat with several seasoned astronomy enthusiasts. Among them was an astrophotographer who shared some of their photos to illustrate the concept of open and closed clusters of stars. Additionally, the AAAP's software-controlled telescope swiftly rotated and pinpointed an open cluster of stars, allowing me to observe it in the night sky through the telescope.

One of the memorable conversations with the members was when he mentioned that what we see in the sky is actually in the past. The light from the stars we are observing has traveled for years, so we are essentially looking back in time. He also pointed out that when we look at someone, we see them as they were milliseconds ago, not in the present. I find this quite interesting. This visit also sparked many questions in my mind. While talking with members of the AAAP, I still wonder what is outside the universe. In other words, where is the universe expanding to? 

During this trip, I felt comfortable and relaxed. The night sky acts as a window to the universe, and it's only when night falls that I can gaze at the stars above and truly feel where I am. I find myself on a planet, surrounded by nebula clouds and stars, within a galaxy, in the universe. I may be tiny in the grand scheme of the universe, but I'm alive and burning bright.
